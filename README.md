#**Codename BlueSky**

Endless runner video game that I made for Estonian IT College in Basic Programming course.

Written in Java.

Compiling from source will fail since it does not include assets, but you are free to try.
If you want to try to compile from source you will require [libGdx](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).
